# Export GitHub Issues to JIRA-compatible CSV format

This software communicates with Github's v3 API, to export
the "Issues" from a project in to a format JIRA can import.

The source is set up for both leiningen and Eclipse, as I sometimes
use the latter.

Note that comment import is broken in JIRA import 4.1.4, and works
correctly starting with JIRA import 4.2.  As of June 2012, unfortunately
the version deployed in JIRA OnDemand is 4.1.4.

## Usage

Use lein deps to download the dependencies.

Edit config.clj with your project settings.

Run the Clojure code, either in an IDE or via lein.

Import the resulting JIRA.CSV file in to JIRA. A sample
JIRA import configuration file is provided, the comment
setting is required for comment import to work.
